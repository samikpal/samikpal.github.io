Blink detection:
This project seeks to help people with permanent disabilities communicate better. Many people who have lost control of most body parts can still intentionally blink. This blinking can be timed and used as mechnism to communicate. This project uses a simple code of blink detection and records the time stamp of the event of detection and uses it to translate to dots or dashes of the morse code. In this I've used only 4 combinations of .'s and -'s to represent 4 different messeges. You can use it to make your own messeges

Happy Blinking! Cheers!

Smart Street lights:
This projects aims at reducing the power consumption of street lights switching 'ON' only in presence of velicles on the road. This helps to reduce the electric consumption on roads which have lights swtiched 'ON' through out the night even without any traffic.
